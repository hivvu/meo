For CSS, the default task is `$ gulp`, which will run all the following commands. Or, you can use them individually as needed.

```
$ gulp build:css // only processes Sass to CSS once

$ gulp sass:watch // run Sass watcher for updated files

$ gulp build:dist // moves processed files from src/ to dist/
```
